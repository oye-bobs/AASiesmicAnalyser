# For this exercise, we'll be working with data from the Yahtse Glacier project, run from 2009 - 2011.  This data, like ~every NSF or NASA funded seismic deployment, is archived at the [IRIS Data Management Center (DMC)](http://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/).  One of the easiest tools for seismic data discovery is through a Google Map add-on.  You can see the map focused near the Yahtse Glacier network [here](http://ds.iris.edu/gmap/?minlat=60&maxlat=61&minlon=-143&maxlon=-140).  There's a nice guide using the map function [here](http://ds.iris.edu/gmap/help).  The short guidelines are simple: change the terms in the URL, and you can change what the map shows.
#
# Using the IRIS [DMC's Google Map function](http://ds.iris.edu/gmap/?minlat=60&maxlat=61&minlon=-143&maxlon=-140), find the Yahtse Glacier network and note the two-character network code that organizes seismic data together.  We'll be working with data from station BOOM.

# ## Detection of calving icequakes
# The simple STA/LTA (ratio of Short-Term-Average to Long-Term-Average) filter and similar filters are a popular, simple way to detect transient seismic events.  You can learn more about these detection tools and their parameters [here](https://docs.obspy.org/tutorial/code_snippets/trigger_tutorial.html).  First, chose the frequency bounds of typical calving icequakes, since we want to limit our assessment of the data to within these frequencies.  When exploring the choice of parameters, start with a short sample of the data (like 10 minutes), and adjust the parameters while re-running detector plots until you are happy with the output.  These parameters include the
# * short term window length,
# * long term window length,
# * on threshold, and
# * off thresholds.
#
# When you've got a set of parameters that you like, change the time of inspected data broadly to different seasons and times of day.  Reassess your parameter choices.  To make this guess-and-check approach more rigorous, you might manually choose some set of training data and systematically explore the parameter space to identify those parameter values that best reproduce your manually-picked events.  However, in practice, this is often not done.  What _must_ be done is some verification that the results of your analysis are not overly sensitive to "reasonable" variations in parameter choices.

# In multiple studies (Qamar, 1988; O'Neel, 2007; Bartholomaus, 2015; Kohler 2016), the duration of calving icequakes  has been shown to be an important predictor of iceberg size and/or calving flux.  Below, calculate and record the cumulative duration of calving events on randomly selected days during the Yahtse seismic experiment.  I recommend choosing some fixed amount of time on the first of each month.  Choose the longest fixed amount of time that you can bear to wait for the data to be retrieved and the analysis to run.
